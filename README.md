# SalesloftDevProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

I maanaged to complete levels 1 and 2 of the following document:

I have some ideas for level 3 and would like to dive deeper on it in the future.

# Notes
This project can be run on a machine that has node.js, npm, and the angular cli. I couldn't figure out how to get around CORS in the app itself since the API doesn't allow cross-origin requests. I ended up using the following plugin for chrome:

Please contact me at nick.m.poirier@gmail.com if you require more instruction/want to dive deeper on the app.
